Documentation

Introduction
------------

MorphIO is a library for reading and writing neuron morphology files. It supports the following
formats:

* SWC
* ASC (aka. neurolucida)
* H5 v1
* H5 v2 is not supported anymore, see `H5v2`_

It provides 3 C++ classes that are the starting point of every morphology analysis:

* ``Soma``: contains the information related to the soma.

* ``Section``: a section is the succession of points between two bifurcations. To the bare minimum
  the ``Section`` object will contain the section type, the position and diameter of each point.

* ``Morphology``: the morphology object contains general information about the loaded cell
  but also provides accessors to the different sections.

One important concept is that MorphIO is split into a *read-only* part and a *read/write* one.


H5v2
====

Starting at version 2.6.0, the file format ``h5v2`` is no longer supported. If you have
morphologies in this format, you can convert them to h5v1 with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install "morphio<2.6" "morph-tool==2.3.0"

and then:

.. code-block:: bash

   # single file, OUTPUT must end with `.h5`
   morph-tool convert file INPUTFILE OUTPUT
   # bulk conversion
   morph-tool convert folder -ext h5 INPUTDIR OUTPUTDIR
